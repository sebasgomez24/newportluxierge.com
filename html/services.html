            <h1 class="services">Access Control</h1><hr/><br/><br/><br/>

                    <p>Welcome to the world of intelligent access control. Our systems go far beyond simply unlocking a door when someone enters the appropriate code. When an authorized user attempts access, the doors will be unlocked, lights will turn on, HVAC will adjust, alarm automatically disarms, and a video camera takes a photo. All user activity is logged for review at any time, so you can feel confident in who is actually entering your property.On top of that, we have a more advanced user authentication process than most other solutions. A simple access code won’t necessarily get you in to the structure. Unless you are authorized to be there at that specific date and time with permissions to disarm the security, access is denied.</p><br/>
        
        
                    <p>As if that wasn’t good enough, all of these features can be managed from anywhere in the world, so long as you have a network connection. That means that you can create and modify user permissions from your hotel in Europe or while sitting on the beach in Hawaii. The ability to easily and dynamically control access to your property is invaluable. Not only is this great for safety and security, but convenience and peace of mind. This proves especially use when dealing with multiple vendors and service providers. You can even create a temporary access so someone can enter during a specific window, and never again.</p></div>

            <h1 class="services">Audio Video</h1><hr/><br/><br/><br/>
                    <p>Audio Video and entertainment systems are a great way to relax, entertain, experience new adventures. A properly designed and implemented audio video system can take you out of your seat and put you in the middle of your favorite action film or whisk you to far off lands. Acoustic and video quality is imperative in these scenarios, and our team of experts and consultants deliver these results every time. From the dedicated theater, to the multi-purpose entertainment room, to a poolside cabana, our entertainment solutions are perfect for any environment. Ease of use is critical in these systems, as a frustrating control system is more hassle than it is worth and can ruin a relaxing evening or special event. Distributed audio systems can provide the same or different audio in every zone, giving users individual control of volume and content. </p><br/>


                    <p>Homes, yachts, offices, RV’s, and retail spaces will all benefit from a well designed and installed system. There are a variety of options for each of these environments and each one has it’s own benefits. Our experts will take the time to meet with our clients and determine which system is the best solution and work to produce the best possible resut.</p></div>

            <h1 class="services">Resource Management</h1><hr/><br/><br/><br/>
                    <p>The advancements in technology that we have seen in the past several years have allowed us to take greater responsibility for our environment. Solar energy solutions are readily available and becoming more cost effective all the time. Monitoring our electrical and water consumption allows us to better understand where are resources are going and identify areas of waste. Intelligent automation allows us to manage our energy and water consumption more effectively.</p><br/><br/>
                    <p>Climate controls will adjust dynamically based on real time conditions, lights will turn off in unoccupied rooms, and irrigation systems will react to the weather and adjust accordingly. We can engineer systems to monitor battery and tank levels for eletrical and water storage systems. <br/><br/>These systems can make intelligent decisions that are driven by actual conditions as opposed to simple pre-programmed timers.</p></div>

    <div class="container">
            <a name="solutions"></a>
            <h1 class="services">Security Solutions</h1><hr/><br/><br/><br/>
                    <p>Security systems are critical to bringing us peace of mind. Our systems incorporate CCTV with access control, motion sensors, door and window contacts, glass break sensors, and even military-grade ground radar to secure your property to the greatest extent possible. The integration of security with lighting and CCTV systems creates a solution unparalleled in the marketplace. The ability to view and control these systems remotely allows you to check property when you aren’t there, as well as allow access and review alarms.</p><br/><br/>

                    <p>When an alarm is triggered, video of the event is captured and allows the user to check and make sure the alarm is legitimate, reducing the chance and number of false alarms in a system. Using high quality surveillance cameras and digital recorders, you can view your property inside and out and make sure that all is well. Additionally, with our systems that automatically disable the security system when an authorized user is present, there is no worrying about fumbling on keypads to enter codes and no more annoying beeping when you enter the door.</p>

                    <p>For those client who have multiple estates, our systems allow you to quickly and easily check the status of all properties at a glance and make sure that there are no issues. The ability to monitor literally unlimited numbers of security zones is something that is unmatched by most other providers in the marketplace.</p></div>

            <h1 class="services">Systems Automation</h1><hr/><br/><br/><br/>
                    <p>Our homes, businesses, and yachts are full of various systems. Tying all of the systems together in an intelligent manner is becoming more and more difficult for consumers. Fortunately, our systems present all of these control options in an easy to use, intelligent manner. All control can be done from a single interface, accessed remotely at any time.</p></div>
